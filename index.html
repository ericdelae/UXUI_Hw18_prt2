                <p> This project includes a redeisgn of the home page's navigational 
                    infrastructure and revamped UI to make the site more clear. 
                    The original website was cluttered and a lot of the navigation 
                    did not align with headings.

                    home. It also serves as a inspiration board with fun recipes for special

                    This project redesigned the Orlando Film Festival main site. The UI was
                    dramatically changed, ticket purchasing became a much smoother process,
                    and the site was also reimagined to be a social site to gather film-enthusiats in between major events.

                <h4> Prototyping and Creating Wireframes</h4>
                <p> I really enjoy creating different levels of wireframes and prototypes. The act of bringing ideas to life can be challenging, but this is why it is so rewarding. There is no better way to share with a user your ideas, which is why I push myself to keep learning and work on larger projects to sharpen my skills.

                <h4> Research </h4>
                <p> UX/UI research quickly became one of my favorite necessary components of working on a project. I love gathering research and data to develop boundaries for ideation. As a mechanical engineer, these skills are inate and have translated extremely well into UX/UI.

                <h4> Product Management</h4>
                <p> In my current role, I am a product manager for a USA rollout of a new electric actuator for control valves. I really enjoy working customers, salesmen, expos, and engineers alike. I have sharpened my skills to gain influence for several departments to work together, even though none of them report to me. I am excited to bring these skills from a mechanical workd to a digital one!
